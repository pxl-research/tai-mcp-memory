        Quantum computing is a new type of computing that harnesses the phenomena of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform calculations. Unlike classical computers that store information as bits (0s or 1s), quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This allows quantum computers to process vast amounts of information in parallel, potentially solving problems that are intractable for even the most powerful supercomputers. Applications include drug discovery, materials science, financial modeling, and breaking modern encryption. However, building stable and error-free quantum computers is a significant engineering challenge, and the technology is still in its early stages of development.
